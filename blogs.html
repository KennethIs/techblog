	<h2>Humans Need Not Apply</h2>

		<p>The general idea of the video "Humans Need Not Apply", is that technology is becoming so advanced that people are being fired from their jobs and being replaced with technology. An example being people with office jobs. Software bots are way cheaper and work faster than regular people working behind a computer. Another would be the self driving cars, or automobiles. Although it feels kind of risky, they're already better at driving than people drivers, which is fine. They don't need to be absolutely perfect, they just need to be better tnan people, which they already are.</p>

		<p>After watching the video a few more times in it's entirety, I felt pretty uneasy about the whole situation. My thoughts after initially watching the video was that I was impressed with how far and advanced out technology has come and wasn't worried about it taking over the work force or any of that. But I then realized that this has the chance of affecting me in the future. If everything that is stated in the video is true, then technology could just take over every field of work in society, and there won't be any jobs for people anymore. I feel like that's unfair because they're leaving people unemployed until eventually the entire work force is just robots and technology.</p>

		<h2>Blown to Bits</h2>
		<h3>By: Kenneth Quizhpi</h3>
		<img src="https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/smart-technology-spying.jpg">
			<p>The first section I read of the book Blown to Bits, was "Footprints and Fingerprints". What the section was essntially about how easy it is for anyone to see the websites we've been visiting and the information we leave behind. Anyone could use that information in the hopes to get something from us.</p>

			<p>The second section that I read was "Smile While we Snap". This section explains how posting a photo or video of someone on the internet could lead to that person being more embarresed by more people than the few that witnessed it in person. And bits of information in a photo could be used to track down someone's identity.</p>

			<p>The last section I read was "Knowing Where YOu Are". The section essentially talks about how any piece of technology with a built in GPS can be used to track down anyone in very precise three dimensions. Even if that person doesn't want to be tracked down, they still are. As long as it has signal it can all be used as a tool to track anyone down.</p>

			<p>If I'm being honest I wasn't all that surprised by what the three sections had to say. The only part where I could say I felt surprised was in the second section where apparently bits of information in he coding of a photo could be used as a lead to someones identity. The other sections, though creepy and unsettling, wasn't that much of a surprise to me.</p>

		<h2>The Changes of Technology by a Spectator</h2>
		<h3>By: Kenneth Quizhpi</h3>
			<p>So for this interview, I was originally going to ask my grandpa for his input, but he wasn't around at the time so I asked my mom instead. She's 38 right now and didn't come to the US until she was 15.</p>

			<p>Kenneth: What was you favorite piece of technology when you were growing up?</p>
			<p>Mom: I had a little CD player that I used regularly whenever I was bored or in a long car ride.</p>
			<p>Kenneth: How has technology changed over your lifetime?</p>
			<p>Mom: Things are getting easier and easier to do. They've made some jobs completely obsolete and other jobs have been created with </p>
			<p>Kenneth: Have the changes you've seen in technology over your lieftime mostly helped or hurt society?</p>
			<p>Mom: It's helped society by making things easier and more convenient for everyone.</p>
			<p>Kenneth: What is your greatest hope for technology in the future?</p>
			<p>Mom: Help the less fortunate and ill people.</p>
